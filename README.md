# Shipping-App

This is a basic Shipping App made in Java and was one of my first steps on the language. I had to compressed the file to upload it because of the number of files.

If you want to learn more or even try it yourself you can do so by opening the text file named "User Manual", there you can find the instructions on how to run it.

If you have any questions feel free to ask!
